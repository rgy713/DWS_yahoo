About Burberry:
Thomas Burberry opened his shop in 1856, establishing himself as the go-to purveyor for outdoor apparel. His coats, constructed from the water-resistant, gabardine fabric he invented, would earn Burberry the honor of outfitting trench-fighting British soldiers in WWI. After the war, the ""trench coat"" found its way into civilian life, and soon it became an icon of dapper London style. The trench made Burberry famous, but by 2000 the company had grown into a luxury-clothing juggernaut. Looking to redefine its identity, Burberry tapped fellow Brit Christopher Bailey as chief creative officer in 2001. Under his stewardship, Burberry introduced the Prorsum, London, and Brit linesﾂ預nd has pulled off a unique feat: looking at the past, and toward the future, while hitting on what works today.

About KENZO:
The colorful world of Kenzo was born in 1970 with the opening of founder Kenzo Takada's Paris boutique. Piecing together clothes from fabric scraps found at flea sales, Takada, now retired, took France by storm with his clashing prints, global influences, and exuberant imagination. Under the stewardship of Creative Directors Carol Lim and Humberto Leon of Opening Ceremony, Kenzo today taps into the brand's original DNA to offer reissued safari-themed prints and tiger sweatshirts alongside fresh new designs loyal to the label's history and love of spontaneity.",Kenzo,ケンゾー,http://www.neimanmarcus.com/en-jp/Kenzo-Knit-Tiger-Pullover-Sweater-Gray-Size-12-18M/prod202410045_cat64360762__/p.prod?icid=&searchType=EndecaDrivenCat&rte=%252Fcategory.service%253FitemId%253Dcat64360762%2526pageSize%253D120%2526No%253D120%2526Ns%253DPCS_SORT%2526refinements%253D&grpId=prod202410045&eItemId=prod201840053&cmCat=product&focusProductId=prod201840053,1af91e8324d53294cf8d3756a3d382368b4e897a.jpg

About Burberry:
Thomas Burberry opened his shop in 1856, establishing himself as the go-to purveyor for outdoor apparel. His coats, constructed from the water-resistant, gabardine fabric he invented, would earn Burberry the honor of outfitting trench-fighting British soldiers in WWI. After the war, the ""trench coat""found its way into civilian life, and soon it became an icon of dapper London style. The trench made Burberry famous, but by 2000 the company had grown into a luxury-clothing juggernaut. Looking to redefine its identity, Burberry tapped fellow Brit Christopher Bailey as chief creative officer in 2001. Under his stewardship, Burberry introduced the Prorsum, London, and Brit linesﾂ預nd has pulled off a unique feat: looking at the past, and toward the future, while hitting on what works today.

Thomas Burberry opened his shop in 1856, establishing himself as the go-to purveyor for outdoor apparel.

After the war, the ""trench coat"" found its way into civilian life, and soon it became an icon of dapper London style. The trench made Burberry famous, but by 2000 the company had grown into a luxury-clothing juggernaut. Looking to redefine its identity, Burberry tapped fellow Brit Christopher Bailey as chief creative officer in 2001. Under his stewardship, Burberry introduced the Prorsum, London, and Brit linesﾂ預nd has pulled off a unique feat: looking at the past, and toward the future, while hitting on what works today.
